## Project Architecture

### System Components

The AKS project consists of the following main components:

1. **Backend**: Built with FastAPI, providing RESTful APIs for all system functionality
   - Location: `src/backend/`
   - Main entry point: `src/backend/main.py`

2. **Frontend**: Built with React and Ant Design, providing a user-friendly interface
   - Location: `src/frontend/`
   - Main entry point: `src/frontend/src/main.jsx`

3. **Database**: Relational database storing all system data

### Key Modules

1. **System Management**: User management, role management, permission management
2. **Basic Information Management**: Township management, village management
3. **Land Basic Information**: Agricultural land details, land classification
4. **Land Bidding Management**: Bidding processes, bid management
5. **Contract Management**: Contract creation, management, and tracking
6. **Fee Management**: Fee calculation, collection, and payment tracking
7. **Financing and Confirmation Management**: Financing applications, land right confirmation

## Getting Started

### Project Setup

1. **Backend Setup**
   - Navigate to the backend directory: `cd src/backend`
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Run the server: `uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`

2. **Frontend Setup**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd src/frontend`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Run the development server: `npm run dev`

### API Documentation

Once the backend server is running, you can access the Swagger UI documentation at:
- http://localhost:8000/docs
