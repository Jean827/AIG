## Lessons Learned

### 1. Missing Page Components for Menu Items

#### Issue Description
The system had five menu items that were defined in the menu service but did not have corresponding page components implemented, resulting in 404 errors when users attempted to access these pages. The affected paths were:
- `/auction/record` (竞拍记录管理)
- `/contract/execution` (合同执行管理)
- `/payment/operation` (缴费操作)
- `/payment/history` (已缴费信息查询)
- `/finance/monitor` (资金流向监控)

#### Root Cause
During the initial development phase, the menu service was created with all planned functionality, but the corresponding page components were not fully implemented. This disconnect between menu configuration and actual implementation was not detected during testing.

#### Solution Implemented
We created five new React components to implement the missing functionality:
1. **AuctionRecord.jsx**: Implemented竞拍记录管理功能，包括表格展示、搜索过滤和导出功能。
2. **ContractExecution.jsx**: Implemented合同执行管理功能，包括表格展示、搜索过滤和导出功能。
3. **PaymentOperation.jsx**: Implemented缴费操作功能，包括表格展示、搜索过滤和导出功能。
4. **PaymentHistory.jsx**: Implemented已缴费信息查询功能，包括表格展示、搜索过滤和导出功能。
5. **FundMonitoring.jsx**: Implemented资金流向监控功能，包括表格展示、搜索过滤和图表分析功能。

Additionally, we updated the App.jsx file to add the corresponding routes for these new components.

#### Impact
- **Positive**: Users can now access all menu items without encountering 404 errors, improving the overall user experience.
- **Development**: The project now has a more complete set of features as originally planned.

#### Prevention Measures
- Implement regular reviews to ensure consistency between menu configuration and implemented components.
- Include navigation testing in the test plan to verify all menu items lead to valid pages.
- Consider implementing automated tests that check for broken links and missing components.
