5. Share task-related knowledge during team meetings and knowledge-sharing sessions

## 4. Task Template Customization

This template can be customized to meet the specific needs of different project phases or types of tasks. However, all customizations should maintain the core elements of the template to ensure consistency and completeness. Any significant changes to the template should be reviewed and approved by the project manager and documented in the project management plan.

## 5. Example Task

### Example: User Authentication Module Development

**Task ID**: AKS-001

**Task Name**: Develop User Authentication Module

**Parent Task**: AKS-000: System Architecture Development

**Related User Story/Requirement**: US-001: User Authentication

**Summary**: Develop a secure user authentication module that supports multiple authentication methods and integrates with the system's role-based access control.

**Detailed Description**: This task involves designing and developing a user authentication module that allows users to securely log in to the system. The module should support password-based authentication, as well as integration with third-party authentication providers. It should also integrate with the system's role-based access control to ensure users have appropriate permissions. The module must comply with security best practices and industry standards for authentication.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can successfully register for an account
- Users can log in using their username and password
- Users can reset their password if forgotten
- The system validates user credentials securely
- Failed login attempts are logged and potentially blocked
- The module integrates with the role-based access control system
- All authentication-related data is encrypted
- The module passes security testing
